logistic regression is used for classification
tasks

Ordinary linear regression assumes that the response variable is normally distributed.
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a
function that describes the probability that an observation will have a value between
any two real numbers.


 For instance,
a coin toss can result in two outcomes: heads or tails. The Bernoulli distribution
describes the probability distribution of a random variable that can take the positive
case with probability P or the negative case with probability 1-P


In logistic regression, the response variable describes the probability that the outcome
is the positive case. If the response variable is equal to or exceeds a discrimination
threshold, the positive class is predicted; otherwise, the negative class is predicted.

The
response variable is modeled as a function of a linear combination of the explanatory
variables using the logistic function. Given by the following equation, the logistic
function always returns a value between zero and one


The logit function is the inverse of the logistic function. It links ( ) F x back to a linear
combination of the explanatory variables
