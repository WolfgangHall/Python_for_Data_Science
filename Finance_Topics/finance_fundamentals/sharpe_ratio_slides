- a portfolio is a set of allocations in a variety of securities
    - 20% in apple
    - 30% in ford
    - 50% in google

- percentages should add up to 100%

-> daily returns
    - percent returned from 1 day to the next for a stock

-> cumulative return
    - the amount returned after an entire time period

-> avg. daily return
    - mean of the daily returns

-> std. daily return
    - std dev of daily returns
    - volatility

Sharpe Ratio
    - measure for calculating risk-adjusted return
    - ratio has become industry standard
    - Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe

    S = ( (Rp - Rf) / sigma p )

    Rp is expected portfolio return
    Rf is risk-free return
    sigma p is portfolio standard deviation

    - What is risk free return?
        => the return you would receive if you put your money in an investment such as a bank savings account, LIBOR, treasury bonds
            - these are essentially 'risk free'

            - these returns are very close to 0%

            - federal reserve may raise interests rates in the futures

    - assuming Rf is 0
        SR = mean return / std dev

    - originally thought of as a yearly metric
        - mean yearly return vs mean daily return

        -> we are usually dealing with weekly or daily data
            - ratio is easy to fix

    - annualized sharpe ratio can be obtained by multiplying against a k-factor off the sampling rate
        - Daily -> K = sqrt(252)
        - weekly -> K = sqrt(52)
        - monthly -> K = sqrt(12)

        ASR = K * SR
