Feature Engineering

    - process of creating new input features for machine learning
    - one of the most effective ways to improve predictive models

    - can isolate key information
    - highlight patterns
    - bring in domain expertise

    - no 'right' answer



    1. Indicator variables
        - using indicator variables to isolate key info

        -> indicator variables from threshholds
            age >= 21 on an alcohol study

        -> indicator variables from multiple features
            number of beds and number of bathrooms

        -> indicator variable for special events
            indicate black friday and christmas

        -> indicator variable for groups of classes
            splitting traffic source with whether or not its paid for


    2. Interaction features
        - highlight interactions between two or more features
        - some fetures can be combined to provide more information than they would as individuals

        - combos:
            - sums
            - difference
            - product
            - quotient


    3. Feature Representation
        - consider if you gain information by representing the same feature in a different way

        -> date and time features
            - grabbing day of week and hour of day from purchase date time

        -> numeric to categorical mappings
            - turn years in school to classes -> elementary, middle, high, college

        -> grouping sparse classes
            - if you have a feature with many classes that have low sample counts
                -> group similar classes and have an other class

        -> creating dummy variables
            - do this after grouping sparse classes


    4. External Data

        -> time series data

        -> external APIs

        -> Geocoding

        -> other sources of the same data


    5. Error Analysis (Post-modeling)
        - performed after training your first model
        - analyzing the misclassified or high error observations from your model
            -> decide next steps for improvement

        - could be collecting more data, splitting problem apart, feature engineering

        -> Start with larger errors
            - check out higher error score problems first

        -> segment by classes
            - segment your observations and compare the average error within each segment
            - try creating indicator variables for the segments with the highest errors

        -> unsupervised clustering
            - run unsupervised clustering algorithm on misclassied observations

        -> ask collegues or domain experts
