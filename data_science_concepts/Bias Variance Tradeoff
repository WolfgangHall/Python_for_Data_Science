Bias Variance Tradeoff

    -> Bias vs Variance => two types of prediction errors
        -> diagnose the performance of an algorithm by breaking down prediction errors

    Bias
        -> occurs when an algorithm has limited flexibility to learn the true signal from a dataset
        -> the difference between your model's expected predictions and the true values

    Vraiance
        -> refers to an algorithms sensitivity to specific sets of training data


    High Bias, Low Variance
        -> models are consistent but innacurrate on average
        -> darts are grouped but not in the middle

        => Low variance
            - tend to be less complex
            - simple or rigid underlying structure

            - Regression
                => can be regularized to reduce complexity further
            - Naive Bayes
            - Linear algorithms
            - Parametric algorithms

        -> algorithms that are not complex enough produce underfit models that dont learn the signal from the data

    High Variance, Low Bias
        -> models are accurate on average but inconsistent
        -> darts are near the middle, but not grouped

        => Low Bias
            - tend to be more complex
            - flexible underlying structure

            - Decision trees
                - can be pruned to reduce complexity
            - Nearest Neighbors
            - Non-linear algorithms
            - Non-parametric algorithms

        -> algorithms that are too complex produce overfit models
            - memorize the noise instead of the signal


- Need to balance Bias and Variance to minimize the total error

Total Error = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error

    -> irreducible error is noise, can be reduced with better data cleaning
        - things like inherent randomness, mis-framed problem, incomplete feature set


Proper Workflow helps
    - separate training and test sets
    - try appropriate algorithms
    - fit model parameters
    - tune impactful hyperparameters
    - proper performance metrics
    - systematic cross validation


- Ultimate goal of supervised machine learning is to isolate the signal while ignoring the noise in the dataset
