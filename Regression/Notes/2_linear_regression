Simple Linear Regression

- goal is to predict the value of a continuous response variable

- simple linear regression models a linear relationship between one response variable and one explanatory variable

- a cost function, or loss function, is used to define and measure the error of a model

- differences in prediction and observed prices in the training set are called residuals or training errors

- differences between predicted and observed values in the test data are called prediction or test errors

- produce best predictor by minimizing the sum of the residuals

- Variance is a measure of how far a set of values is spread out.

- A small variance indicates that the numbers are near the mean of the set

Covariance is a measure of how much two variables change together

R-squared measures how well
the observed values of the response variables are predicted by the model. More
concretely, r-squared is the proportion of the variance in the response variable that
is explained by the model
